Fraud Detection Project V0.36
This project demonstrates my skills in data science and machine learning by developing a fraud detection model from scratch. The project leverages several data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling techniques to effectively identify fraudulent transactions.

Overview
The goal of this project is to build a fraud detection system that accurately classifies transactions as either fraudulent or genuine. By processing and analyzing transactional data, I aim to create a model that helps reduce losses caused by fraud while minimizing false positives.

Features and Techniques
Data Exploration & Preprocessing

Performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, distributions, and potential anomalies.
Handled missing values, outliers, and conducted necessary imputation to prepare the data for modeling.
Implemented data normalization and scaling for feature consistency.
Feature Engineering

Created new features from the raw dataset to improve model accuracy.
Selected and optimized relevant features to reduce noise and improve performance.
Modeling & Evaluation

Experimented with several machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to detect fraudulent transactions.
Tuned model parameters and employed cross-validation to assess model performance and prevent overfitting.
Evaluated the models using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Advanced Techniques

Applied techniques such as feature importance analysis and ROC curve plotting for model evaluation.
Automated parts of the preprocessing and modeling pipelines to streamline the workflow.
Visualization

Utilized libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize patterns in the data and the performance of the models.
Generated plots to support data insights and results interpretation.
